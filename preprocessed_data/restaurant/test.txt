go roth try served mike great
expected menu comprised pad thai tom yum soup thought made place special
ordered tamarind duck wife ordered noodle ground beef delighted way dish evoked thai flavor unexpected way
instead pan asian thought simply creative take thai cuisine much rather innovation traditional thai spice another unremarkable noodle dish
plus entree held kitchen busy saturday night owner sent complimentary summer roll hold u
waitress sweet accomodating overbearing
music get little loud time made want lean closer beautiful wife got whiff corriander
would wanna live
liked food quasi thai restaurant
nice fresh ca give high score authentic thai

favor dinner see dont agree
eye place promising one day give try hate say doubt ever go back
food average thai fusion stuff bit sweet every thing serve sweet
thing moderately enjoyed grilled chicken special edamame puree
never edamame pureed thought innovative tasty could used bit salt

new restaurant still feature much classical furniture made tiffin attractive menu overhauled
meat dish adorn selection although still large number vegetarian friendly choice
southern indian cuisine still
classical restaurant fare chef given new life old cuisine really innovative tasty dish genuinely indian without heavy old restaurant burn out
probably much busier lunch seldom crowded dinner close downtown
well worth trip close city hall downtown subway stop
lobster sandwich fantastic

recommend getting reservation even though saw people seated without one
waited bar martini right

service efficient courteous
two u got lobster roll 24 two opted codfish pea risotto carrot reduction 21 bread roll soft buttery lobster salad fresh tasting couldve little generous meat bay fry well seasoned came vinegar dipping ketchup available codfish decent fresh reduction especially interesting found white flesh slightly bland though skin seasoned perfection
